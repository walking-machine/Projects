# Machine Learning Workshop for Mercedes-Benz Bank Enployees
I created and delivered this workshopas  a member of Students' Robotics Association on sponsorship conditions. Model predicts a price of a used car based on year, mileage and model name (which is coded with embeddings). Unfortunately, the jupyter notebook that was originally used during the workshop was lost, so only the program is available.\
Trained using this [dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jpayne/852k-used-car-listings).\
Model, which is created in this script achieves mean percentage error below 15%, which is a good result, considering the data does not follow strict rules. Performance could be improved by further data preprocessing.\
