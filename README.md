# Welcome!
Hi, my name is Larysa Zaremba and this is my portfolio directory.\
I am a Robotics Student at WUT and an active member of the students robotics association.\
I possess some practical experience with C# and Python, but now I am much more interested in C/C++ Development and Systems Programming.\
Here you can get familiar with source code of some of my projects.\
\
*Many of my projects are not listed in this directory, there are several reasons for this:*
1) *Publishing source code cam violate course rules, therefore I do not publish my online courses assignments. For example, projects for Algorithms by Princeton University (in Java) are not listed here.*
2) *Application is currently used by Students' Robotics Association KNR.*
3) *Source code was lost (applies mostly to old personal projects).*
4) *Project does not possess a stable version*
4) *Source code could rather harm my image as a programmer.*
