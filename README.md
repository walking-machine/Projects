# Welcome!
Hi, my name is Larysa Zaremba and this is my portfolio directory.\
I am a Robotics Student at WUT and an active member of the students robotics association.\
I possess some practical experience with C# and Python, but now I am much more interested in C/C++ Development and Systems Programming. I am also ML and CV enthusiast.\
Here you can get familiar with source code of some of my projects.\
\
\
<sub><sup>*Many of my projects are not listed in this directory, there are several reasons for this:*
- *Publishing source code cam violate course rules, therefore I do not publish my online courses assignments. For example, projects for Algorithms by Princeton University (in Java) are not listed here.*
- *Application is currently used by Students' Robotics Association KNR.*
- *Source code was lost (applies mostly to old personal projects).*
- *Project does not possess a stable version*
- *Source code could rather harm my image as a programmer.*
